# ~*xyz.cobra-load.hax*~

xyz.cobra-load.hax is a website for me to host my personal media content in a safe and verifiable way
but also making it easy to use, Mobile friendly, fast, safe, and most importantly, private way. But 
the thing to remember is this is MY website, I'M making it, and it's soley for the purpose of my
amusement, education, and simplification of the internet. I cannot make a website "work for your phone"
or "compatible with all devices". Case in point, the PlayStation 3 Systems in-built web browser doesn't 
load all types of webpages, and as much as I would like to have support for every type of browser, device,
and connection, I can't. I will try my best, however, to make this a feature rich, worth using, beautifully 
and we'll designed website.
