My Personal Domain

I opened this GitHub to have a public place where others can access my personal files, programs, movies, music,
etc. without the need for others to track down and find software like I had to. Escpecially since nowadays 
even HTTPS websites such as direct links from HTTPS://MicroSoft.com/ show that some ads or something is 
making oyour connection insecure, even though these companies are required by both moral and legal law to protect
our privacy. So it doesn't suffice saying that the internet can be a bad place for someone looking to do no harm. Thats
why my personal website is on GitHub, where anybody and everybody can freely and safely access my website, all the while you're able to view the source code and know you're safe.
